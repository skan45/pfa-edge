# Plateforme intelligente de gestion du trafic routier

## Summary

Developed an intelligent traffic management system with real-time vehicle detection and dynamic light control using AWS and simulation tools. Key components include:

- Simulated traffic with **SUMO** on AWS EC2 and streamed screenshots every 5 simulation steps via **Flask** and **TraCI**.
- Used **AWS Kinesis** for real-time image streaming; images processed with **OpenCV** in **AWS Lambda** to estimate vehicle counts.
- Triggered Lambda functions to update traffic lights based on analysis, applying decisions live in the simulation via Flask.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- SUMO  
- TraCI  
- OpenCV  
- AWS EC2  
- AWS Lambda  
- AWS Kinesis  
- DynamoDB  
- Terraform  

## Deployment

The infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, which automates the following resources:

- Creation of a **VPC** to isolate the environment.
- Provisioning of an **EC2 instance** to host the SUMO simulation and Flask application.
- Configuration of **AWS Lambda** functions for image processing and traffic light control.
- Use of **AWS Kinesis** for real-time image streaming.
- Storage of Terraform backend state securely in an **S3 bucket** with state locking enabled.

This setup ensures a scalable, secure, and reproducible deployment environment.
